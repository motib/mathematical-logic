LearnSAT is a Prolog program for learning about SAT solving. It
implements the classic Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm,
together will modern extensions of the algorithm: conflict-driven clause
learning (CDCL) and non-chronological backtracking (NCB).

The software is made available under the GNP General Public License; see
